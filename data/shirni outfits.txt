	description "This generator combines some energy generation with a small amount of shield generation, all in a much smaller space than most other races could fit both. This compact and versatile outfit also provides a tiny amount of protection against weapons that disrupt a ship's shield matrix."

	description "The Shirni build shield regeneration into their generators, so that when they are recharging their shields the extra power can be drawn by adjusting the generator settings rather than risking running out of energy in the middle of a battle."
	description "Because these systems primarily serve as generators, weapons designed to disrupt shields are less effective against them."

	description "The I-Type Generator is a recent design by the Shirni, who needed additional power for their newer, more advanced warships. Providing large amounts of power alongside integrated shield generation allows the ship this generator is equipped on to maintain its systems even while under sustained fire."

	description "This massive bundle of solar cells is repurposed from designs used in some Shirni factories. While it produces plenty of power, it is designed to operate with the cooling effects of an atmosphere and thus can easily cause the ship using it to overheat."

	description "The Thunderbolt-Type Thruster, despite behaving like an afterburner, is not technically one. Rather, it is a high-intensity thruster, using monumental amounts of power to produce similarly excessive thrust. While it is almost impossible to concieve of a ship that could keep it active for any length of time, the Thunderbolt provides a sudden burst of speed worthy of its namesake to all but the largest ships."
	description "Unlike other Shirni engines, which are designed to operate in every concievable circumstance, the Thunderbolt-Type is designed to allow for a brief burst of speed, in order to escape from a losing battle that would otherwise prove fatal."
