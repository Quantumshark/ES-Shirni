planet Atokiza
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/snow5
	description `Atokiza's surface is covered in a layer of ice and snow. Beneath this layer, however, is a vast ocean kept liquid by the radioactive decay of the unusually high concentration of radioisotopes in the planet's core.`
	description `	A massive station, located on what would be a small island if the ocean were not frozen over, pumps up material from the planet's core and filters out fissile isotopes.`
	spaceport `With the exception of the landing pads, the entire spaceport here is built underneath the ice. Huge windows provide a view of the clear, empty ocean as it stretches endlessly in every direction.`

planet Bakudara
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/forest3
	description `The jungles of Bakudara are full of some of the most terrifying organisms you have ever seen. The apex predators appear to be many-legged flying invertebrates the size of a fighter and massive burrowing mole-like organisms that produce huge mountains when they emerge.`
	description `	The Shirni use this planet as a test site for their starships' weaponry. Every now and then one of the massive flying beasts gets too close to one of the test sites and must be scared off with a flight of plasma rockets.`
	spaceport `The Shirni here all appear to be weapons engineers. A sizable crowd of them are staring at the weapons on your ship, perhaps hoping to discover how they work.`

	spaceport `Sections of the architecture of the spaceport resemble some of the older buildings on the Shirni's nearby homeworld. The spaceport, as with most Shirni spaceports, has far fewer shops than the majority of human spaceports and a huge variety of restaurants.`

planet Cipodeku
	attributes shirni factory urban arid
	landscape land/nasa2
	description `This is a factory world, where electronics and industrial equipment are produced for the whole of Shirni space. The atmosphere is unbreathable, full of smoke and fumes, and the ocean is highly acidic and has turned a sickly green colour.`
	description `	Huge aerial vehicles covered in solar panels float through the upper atmosphere, powered by the searingly bright sunlight that scorches the planet. Every so often, one of these vehicles lands to transfer its battery power to one of the factories below.`
	spaceport `To enter the spaceport, your ship has to pass through a triple airlock. You can see the air brought in with you mixing with the clear air in the first chamber, before it is filtered out in the second.`
	spaceport ` The spaceport itself is brightly coloured and full of vibrant plant life, in stark contrast with the rest of this planet.`

planet "Citoka Shibizi"
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/snow2
	description `This frozen moon, orbiting a gas giant in a dead-end system distant from any other civilisation, is home to a vast underground complex of cryogenic preservation cells. The cells are configured to release a contingent of twenty thousand Shirni every fourty years, as a measure to prevent the extinction of their species. The Shirni in the cells are all volunteers, chosen to ensure that each contingent has enough of a variety of skills to rebuild their entire society.`
	spaceport `The workers here refuel your ship, but it is clear you are not permitted to leave it. There are galleries of carefully maintained ships here, specially prepared for the Shirni in cryogenic storage.`

planet Docitari
	attributes shirni urban arid
	landscape land/city4
	description `This planet is the most populous in all of Shirni space, home to almost twice earth's population. The planet has huge underground caverns, which have been converted into additional urban areas complete with artificial sky on the ceilings to prevent claustrophobia. The primary industries on this planet are mining and software development.`
	spaceport `There are two spaceports on this planet. One of them is huge, established as a cargo port for transporting metals around Shirni space. The other, the spaceport you are permitted to visit, is almost empty, with robots and digital displays performing the roles of most of the staff.`

planet Kozarna
	attributes shirni arid
	landscape land/dune0
	description `Despite the slightly arid climate, Kozarna is a heavily populated planet. When the Shirni first arrived here they found huge reserves of oil, which are now exhausted. Instead of leaving the planet, the Shirni converted it into a farming planet for various exotic foods.`
	spaceport `The spaceports here are busier than any you have seen elsewhere in Shirni space. Upon closer inspection, you realise that the whole spaceport is serving as an enormous food market with a vast variety of exotic foodstuffs. Despite the alien nature of most of the food, you are eventually able to find something to your liking.`

planet Kutaze
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/dmottl4
	description `Kutaze is an idyllic resort world. All workers, regardless of their position, on the nearby factory world of Cipodeku are entitled to one month each year of free vacation on Kutaze to make up for the factory world's oppressive environment.`
	spaceport ` The spaceport seems to have been intentionally built much larger than necessary, in order to provide a more pleasant atmosphere. A variety of art adorns sections of the walls, and calming music plays quietly in the background.`

planet Lizorati
	attributes shirni arid
	landscape land/hills1
	description `Lizorati is a lifeless world, with no atmospheric oxygen and dry, dusty soil that blows away in the wind. The Shirni settlement here serves as a prison for the Alphas captured in their attempted invasion of Shirni space.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is hundreds of miles away from the prison, with the only transport between the two in small vehicles which can easily be searched to prevent escape.`

planet Quta'ar
	attributes quarg station
	landscape land/station2
	description `This Quarg ringworld is not much closer to being completed than the one in human space, with much of the difference being internal rather than in the segments of the ring. Unlike that ringworld, however, this one is inhabited. Based on the size of the completed sections of the ring, you estimate that it is home to tens of billions of Quarg.`
	spaceport `The spaceport's architecture resembles the Quarg architecture you have seen elsewhere. There is evidence of some limited attempts to accommodate the Shirni, but they seem to have been given up on fairly shortly after the construction of the spaceport began.`
	spaceport ` There are almost no Shirni here. It seems only a small portion of them are willing to visit this region.`

planet Quzo'ar
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/badlands2
	description `This tiny, sun-scorched desert moon is the site of a recent major Shirni industrial development. The original settlements here were tiny outposts established to monitor the Quarg, which were abandoned once the Shirni realised that the Quarg were not hostile.`
	description `	The industries here specialise in technology based off the Quarg, similar to the Tarazed corporation in human space.`
	spaceport `The architecture here is an odd mixture of Quarg and Shirni. The hallways, unlike those in most other buildings in Shirni space, are tall enough that a Quarg can stand fully upright and painted to resemble the interior of a Quarg ringworld. There are many Quarg here, some of whom you suspect are monitoring the industries on the planet.

planet Rikuzari
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/water4
	description `This moon is covered in a freshwater ocean, kept liquid by tidal forces from the gas giant it orbits. Rikuzari provides the drinking water for many of the more arid Shirni worlds, which is transported in specially modified freighters.`
	spaceport `Your ship is extensively decontaminated in midair over the polar icecap before you are allowed to land. Once you land, your cargo and outfits are put through a similar procedure, as are you the moment you step off your ship. It seems the Shirni want to minimise the chance of alien pathogens entering their water supply.`
	spaceport ` The spaceport facilities are fairly rudimentary apart from the massive pumps for loading water onto ships. Evidently this moon is not expected to recieve many visitors.`

planet Shibirni
	attributes shirni urban
	landscape land/city1
	description `Shibirni was the first planet the Shirni reached outside their home system. The urban areas are all planned, with large skyscrapers abruptly giving way to idyllic countryside and streets forming a triangular grid.`
	spaceport `There are two spaceports on this planet. The first is relatively small for the planet's population, having been designed when the planet was originally settled. The second is huge, easily as large as some cities in human space.`

planet Shipoderni
	attributes shirni urban
	landscape land/city12
	description `This is the home planet of the Shirni. The population is slightly more than that of earth, but due to the Shirni's small size the extent of the urban regions is lesser.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an odd mixture of several quite different architectures. Many of the older buildings have sharp triangular shapes and appear to be made of a concrete-like material.`

planet Tazarna
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/beach2
	description `The primary industry on Tazarna is the farming of a species of rapidly growing kelp-like algae. Most fabrics in use in Shirni space are made from processed algal fibres farmed on this planet.`
	spaceport `The docks for the massive cargo ships ferrying huge loads of kelp are situated as close to the spaceport as possible, to maximise the efficiency of the loading and unloading processes. There are large teams of Shirni whose jobs appear to consist entirely of hosing down the floors with a chemical that serves both as a cleaning fluid and as a form of odour control.`

planet Vuzotarne
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/lava4
	description `Vuzotarne is the centre of the research efforts of the Shirni. It is here that new technology is developed to further the Shirni's civilisation. Vuzotarne is also home to much of the best higher education in all of Shirni space.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is sleek and modern, with smooth, reflective walls illuminated by blueish light. There is a second spaceport on the other side of the planet which is restricted to only those involved directly with cutting-edge research projects.`

	description `Xidera is a cold, wet farming world where the Shirni grow a species of edible fungus that forms the basis of much of their diet. The sun is perpetually obscured by clouds, and days without precipitation are almost unheard of.`
	spaceport `The spaceport dwarfs every other urban region on this planet - this city easily holds more than two thirds of the planet's entire population. The spaceport has an extensive drainage system, to prevent the heavy rainfall from causing flooding.`

planet Ziderali
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/snow9
